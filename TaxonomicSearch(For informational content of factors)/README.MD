The main task of this method is to get some informational content of factors.

Algorithm of the directed taxonomic search of attributes (NTPO).

Step 1. Solve the problem of clustering n features into m clusters.


Step 2. Select a typical characteristic in each cluster. Such signs will be as independent as possible from one another.
Step 3. Determine the number m 'ï€¼ m. Performing enumeration of factors from m to m '(total Cm' times), identifying
m
the corresponding sample and checking their accuracy on the control sample, we conclude on the composition of the set of informative features.

In this example, I will use USA Housing dataset.
