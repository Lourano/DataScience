# NumericalMethods

Numerical methods -  methods that allow you to calculate the equation / integral,
and etc. using numbers/graphs and algorithms. Of course, that analytic calculation is the best option,
because there is not calculation-error there. 

Ok, Imagine that you decide to solve an integral which
is not solved by analytic method or you have a very complicated derivative for which there is not too much time to solve it
using an analytical method, so you have to use numerical methods!
